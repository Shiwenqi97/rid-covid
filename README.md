# RID-COVID: Radiological Image Data for Clinical Open-source Viral Infection Diagnosis

A list of software projects, datasets, and other publicly available resources for diagnosing COVID-19 based on clinical images such as X-rays and CT scans.

For now, the goal is to help people find what already exists. Eventually this effort may develop into a project to produce new diagnostic tools suitable for clinical use.

**NOTE**

This list focuses on a specific topic: image-based diagnosis of COVID-19.

For a broader range of COVID-19 projects and other information, I recommend lists such as [Open-Source-Covid-19](http://open-source-covid-19.weileizeng.com/) and the [Coronavirus Tech Handbook](https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/).
